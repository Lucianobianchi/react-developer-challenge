# React Dev Challenge

The idea of this challenge is to evaluate your skills as a [React](https://reactjs.org) Developer.

# Exercise

1. Connect and disconnect a browser wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
2. Show the amount of ETH on the connected wallet.
3. List the top 10 active cryptocurrencies with latest market data sorted by market cap from https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyListingsLatest. *Note*: You can get a free API key from https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/?plan=0.
4. Show how much of each asset the user can buy with the amount of ETH in the wallet. E.g.: if the user has 2 ETH, how much of a BTC can he buy with it?

# Think about

- Taking a look at the CoinMarketCap API documentation
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?
- Think about the UX, minimize the number of interactions to use the application
- Take care of your environment variables

## Criteria

The things that we will pay attention to are:

- Commit history
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility
- Knowledge of web3
- Good design practices

## Desirable

- Type all elements used in the app
- Add unit tests, with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for functions and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for components
- Add integration tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or similar testing frameworks
